# Digital Gardening

Digital gardening is a philosophy and approach to creating and maintaining a personal knowledge base on the web. It's about cultivating your thoughts and ideas over time, rather than treating them as finished products.

## Core Principles

1. **Growth Over Time**: Like a real garden, your digital garden is never finished. It grows and evolves as you learn and think.
2. **Interconnectedness**: Ideas are linked together, forming a network of knowledge.
3. **Public Learning**: Sharing your learning process and thinking in public.
4. **Imperfection**: Embracing the messy, imperfect nature of learning and thinking.
